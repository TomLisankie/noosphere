This repository contains documentation and specifications for the Noosphere protocol. Noosphere, like its namesake, is the space that represents our collective knowledge and reason. We like to think of it as a protocol for thought.

Noosphere is the foundational protocol that the Subconscious app builds upon to enable an open-ended, permissionless multiplayer experience. The documentation and specifications in this repository are intended to enable others to contribute to our efforts, and also to build clients and deploy infrastructure that interoperates over Noosphere.

## Project layout

- The [**docs**](docs) contain usage instructions relevant to users of our first-party Noosphere projects
- The [**specs**](specs) are where we define how the core protocol works, and may be most interesting to those who wish to build interoperable projects
